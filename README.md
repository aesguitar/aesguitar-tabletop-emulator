# aesguitar-tabletop-emulator
a project i'm working on for fun

The end goal of this project is to be a fully networked tabletop RPG emulator 
with support for multiple rule sets and custom everything.
This is a lofty goal and may never come to fruition.

Currently, there is a basic incomplete UI representation of the character creation form for DnD. It is only for show at the moment and does not support all the necessary functions for a character creater yet.
