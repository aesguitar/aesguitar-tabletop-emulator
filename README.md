# aesguitar-tabletop-emulator
a project i'm working on for fun

The end goal of this project is to be a fully networked tabletop RPG emulator 
with support for multiple rule sets and custom everything.
This is a lofty goal and may never come to fruition.

Currently, there is no gui and only very basic character creation functionality is available.
It does not support races in character creation yet nor does it support saving the character
once it has been created.
